## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| GPU | NVIDIA with Compute Capability ≥ 7.5 (Turing / RTX 20xx series or newer) |
| VRAM | ≥ 8 GB recommended; minimum 4 GB for small point clouds |
| RAM | ≥ 16 GB recommended for large point clouds |
| CPU | Multi-core (≥ 8 cores recommended to speed up the C++ build stage) |
| Disk | ≥ 20 GB free for the Docker image plus runtime data |

> **CPU-only mode:** The application automatically falls back to the CPU binary
> (`feature_extraction_viewer_cpu`) when no CUDA-capable GPU is detected. Feature
> extraction and Random Forest inference will be significantly slower.

## Software Requirements

| Software | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | ≥ 20.10 | |
| NVIDIA Driver | ≥ 520 | Required for CUDA 11.8 support |
| nvidia-container-toolkit | Current | Enables GPU passthrough inside Docker containers |

### Installing nvidia-container-toolkit (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release; echo $ID$VERSION_ID)

curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | \
  sudo apt-key add -

curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Building the Docker Image

The `Dockerfile` uses a **multi-stage build**:

- **Stage 1 — builder** (`nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04`): compiles
  LASzip, laz-perf, GDAL 3.6.2, and PDAL 2.7.1 from source, then builds all eight
  C++ processing binaries.
- **Stage 2 — runtime** (`nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04`): installs
  Python 3.10, runtime system libraries, and Python packages (including PyTorch 2.3.0
  + CUDA 11.8 and RAPIDS cuML), then copies the compiled binaries from Stage 1.

### Standard build

```bash
docker build -t 3d-classify-viewer .
```

### Build with parallel compilation (recommended)

Set `NUM_THREADS` to the number of available CPU cores to speed up the C++ compilation:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NUM_THREADS=16 -t 3d-classify-viewer .
```

> **Note:** The first build takes 20–40 minutes depending on network speed and CPU
> core count, as it compiles GDAL, PDAL, and multiple C++ binaries from source.
> Subsequent builds benefit from Docker layer cache and complete significantly faster
> when only Python or Django files are changed.

## Running the Application

### Production Mode (Gunicorn)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --gpus all \
  --name classify-viewer \
  3d-classify-viewer
```

The application is served by Gunicorn (1 worker, 2 threads, no timeout) on port **8000**.
Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.

To **persist runtime data** (uploaded point clouds, trained models) between container
restarts, mount a host directory:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --gpus all \
  -v "$(pwd)/runtime_data:/webapp/classifyViewer/runtime_data" \
  --name classify-viewer \
  3d-classify-viewer
```

### Development Mode (Django Dev Server)

```bash
docker run -it \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --gpus all \
  -v "$(pwd)/classifyViewer:/webapp/classifyViewer" \
  3d-classify-viewer \
  python classifyViewer/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Mounting the source directory enables live code reloading. Changes to Python files
and templates take effect immediately without rebuilding the image.

## Environment Validation

After starting the container, run the following checks to verify the environment.

### Check GPU availability

```bash
docker exec classify-viewer nvidia-smi
```

Expected: the NVIDIA GPU, driver version, and CUDA version are listed.

### Check runtime libraries

```bash
docker exec classify-viewer ldconfig -p | grep -E 'gdal|pdal|laszip|pcl'
```

Expected: entries for `libgdal`, `libpdal_base`, `liblaszip`, and `libpcl_*`.

### Check C++ binaries

```bash
docker exec classify-viewer ls -la /webapp/opt/
```

Expected: eight executable files — `feature_extraction_viewer_gpu`,
`feature_extraction_viewer_cpu`, `subsample_pc`, `mesh2pc`, `ply2las`,
`split_las_by_binary`, `las_to_feature_bin`, `check_point_id`.

### Check Python / CUDA environment

```bash
docker exec classify-viewer python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Expected output: `True` when a CUDA-capable GPU is present and the driver is correctly
configured.

## Troubleshooting

### `nvidia-smi` not found inside the container

Ensure `nvidia-container-toolkit` is installed on the host and Docker was restarted
after installation. The `--gpus all` flag must be passed to `docker run`.

### `cannot open shared object file: libgdal.so`

Run `ldconfig` inside the container to refresh the dynamic linker cache, then verify
the library path:

```bash
docker exec classify-viewer sh -c 'echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
```

The path must include `/usr/local/lib`.

### `CUDA out of memory` during feature extraction

Increase the subsampling voxel size before running feature extraction to reduce point
density, or set `use_gpu: false` in the feature extraction request to use the CPU
fallback binary.

### Port 8000 already in use

Map to a different host port:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:8000 --gpus all 3d-classify-viewer
```

### Large file uploads failing

The default upload limit is 5 GB (`DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` in `settings.py`).
For files exceeding this limit, increase the value and rebuild the image.
