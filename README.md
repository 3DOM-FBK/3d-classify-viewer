# 3D Classify Viewer

A web-based application for interactive visualization and supervised classification of
3D point clouds. It combines a Django REST backend, a BabylonJS + Potree 2.0 frontend,
and a GPU-accelerated C++ processing pipeline to support the full workflow — from raw
3D data upload to labeling, feature extraction, Random Forest training, and classified
output export.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format input** — PLY, LAS, GLB, GLTF meshes are automatically
  sampled to point clouds
- **GPU-accelerated feature extraction** — per-point geometric descriptors (anisotropy,
  linearity, planarity, etc.) computed at multiple radius using CUDA; CPU fallback
  included
- **Interactive point selection and labeling** — rectangular, lasso, and polygon
  selection tools for annotating training regions directly in the 3D viewport
- **Random Forest classification** — GPU-accelerated training and inference via RAPIDS
  cuML; scikit-learn CPU fallback for non-GPU environments
- **LOD streaming** — large point clouds streamed with adaptive level-of-detail via
  Potree 2.0
- **Prediction visualization** — discrete per-class coloring and confidence overlay
- **Export** — download classified segments and trained models as a single ZIP package

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured in three layers:

1. **Frontend** — BabylonJS 3D scene with Potree 2.0 LOD streaming. All user
   interaction (selection tools, class registry, colormap, segment management) runs
   in the browser.
2. **Django backend** — REST API with 30+ endpoints that orchestrate file uploads,
   C++ pipeline invocation, model management, and file serving (including HTTP Range
   support for large binary files).
3. **C++ processing pipeline** — eight pre-compiled binaries at `/webapp/opt/` inside
   the container, covering format conversion, subsampling, GPU/CPU feature extraction,
   Potree conversion, and `.pcbin` binary export. Invoked from Python via `subprocess`.

For a detailed breakdown, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Docker | ≥ 20.10 |
| NVIDIA GPU | Compute Capability ≥ 7.5 (Turing / RTX 20xx or newer) |
| NVIDIA Driver | ≥ 520 |
| VRAM | ≥ 8 GB recommended for large point clouds |
| nvidia-container-toolkit | any current release |

> The application falls back to CPU for feature extraction and RF inference when no
> CUDA-capable GPU is detected, but processing times will be significantly longer.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t 3d-classify-viewer .
```

To speed up the C++ compilation stage, increase the number of parallel build threads:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NUM_THREADS=16 -t 3d-classify-viewer .
```

### 2. Run in production

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --gpus all 3d-classify-viewer
```

The application is served by Gunicorn on port **8000**. Open `http://localhost:8000`
in a browser.

### 3. Run in development

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --gpus all \
  -v "$(pwd)/classifyViewer:/webapp/classifyViewer" \
  3d-classify-viewer \
  python classifyViewer/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Mounting the source directory enables live code reloading without rebuilding the image.
